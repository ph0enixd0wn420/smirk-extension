/**
 * Grin WASM Wallet Module
 *
 * Re-exports all Grin handlers for use by the background message router.
 *
 * Grin Transaction Model (Mimblewimble):
 * Unlike BTC/LTC, Grin uses interactive transactions requiring both parties
 * to participate in building the transaction. This is called "slates".
 *
 * SRS Flow (Standard Send):
 * 1. Sender creates S1 slate (selects inputs, creates partial signature)
 * 2. Sender sends S1 slatepack to Recipient
 * 3. Recipient signs S2 (adds output, partial signature)
 * 4. Recipient sends S2 slatepack back to Sender
 * 5. Sender finalizes S3 (combines signatures, builds kernel)
 * 6. Sender broadcasts transaction to network
 *
 * RSR Flow (Invoice/Request):
 * 1. Receiver creates I1 invoice (output commitment)
 * 2. Receiver sends I1 to Sender
 * 3. Sender signs I2 (selects inputs, adds signature)
 * 4. Sender sends I2 back to Receiver
 * 5. Receiver finalizes I3 (combines signatures)
 * 6. Receiver broadcasts transaction to network
