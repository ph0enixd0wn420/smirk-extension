# Smirk Extension TODO

## Known Issues (Alpha)

### UX
- [x] Pending tips not reflected in balance immediately (FIXED)
- [ ] Clawback UI could be improved (confirmation flow)
- [ ] Grin fee display before confirming send

---

## WASM Build Transparency

### Current State
- GRIN WASM: Pre-built binaries from MWC Wallet Standalone zip
- Monero WASM: Built locally from smirk-wasm-monero (uses monero-oxide)
- All source repos are public and linked in README

### Phase 1: Documentation (Done)
- [x] Document WASM sources in README.md
- [x] Add build-from-source instructions to BUILDING.md
- [x] Link to Nicolas Flamel's GitHub repos

### Phase 2: Submodules (Future)
Add WASM source repos as git submodules for easier auditing:

```
smirk-extension/
├── deps/
│   ├── secp256k1-zkp-wasm/  (submodule)
│   ├── ed25519-wasm/        (submodule)
│   ├── x25519-wasm/         (submodule)
│   ├── blake2b-wasm/        (submodule)
│   └── smirk-wasm-monero/   (submodule)
```

Benefits:
- Pinned versions via commit hashes
- Easy `git diff` to see changes between releases
- CI can verify submodule commits match expected

### Phase 3: CI-built WASM (Future)
Automate WASM compilation in GitHub Actions:

1. Install Emscripten + Rust WASM target in CI
2. Build all WASM from submodules
3. Compare against committed binaries (or replace them)
4. Fail CI if WASM differs unexpectedly

This would provide reproducible builds without trusting pre-compiled binaries.

## Future: Additional Platforms

- [ ] Signal / Matrix / Simplex (when backend supports)

## In Progress

- [ ] Chrome Web Store submission (pending review)
- [ ] Firefox Add-ons submission (pending review)

## Lower Priority

- [ ] Safari port (requires Xcode + Apple Developer account)
- [ ] Biometric unlock (where supported)
- [ ] Address book / contacts
- [ ] Hardware wallet support

## Architecture Reference

### Grin Key Derivation
```
mnemonic → MWC Seed → Extended Private Key
Per-output: Identifier(depth=3, paths=[0,0,n_child,0])
Commitment = amount*H + blind*G
```

### n_child Management
Backend tracks `MAX(n_child)` across ALL outputs.
Extension MUST use `next_child_index` from `/wallet/grin/user/{id}/outputs`.
